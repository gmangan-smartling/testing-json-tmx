We are a subscription service that provides subscribers with access to a wide range of sports events from around the world streamed to a range of devices including Internet-connected TVs, computers and other platforms (&quot;DAZN Service&quot;). To enhance your enjoyment of the DAZN Service we will also provide recommendations of broadcasts you might be interested in and other interesting sports information.<br>1.2.    The DAZN Service is provided to you by Perform Investment Limited (“We&quot;, &quot;Us&quot;).  We (and not a third party payment provider) are solely responsible for the provision of the DAZN Service and application.<br> 2.    Key Terms of Use<br>2.1.    We provide an online video service offering (among other things) streaming of sporting events (both live and on-demand), highlights of sporting events and other related content, the composition and availability of which may vary over time (collectively &quot;Content&quot;). The Content is usually subject to certain restrictions (including, but not limited to, certain territorial restrictions). You will be able to access and enjoy the DAZN Service within any country where the DAZN Service is available although the Content (and the language it is available in) will vary from territory to territory. If you are verified as being entitled to portability (see our FAQs on this subject), you will be able to access and enjoy the DAZN Service when you are temporally present in another member state of the <a href=\"https://www.linguee.com/english-german/translation/European+Economic+Area.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">European Economic Area</span></span></a> (“EEA”), irrespective of whether the DAZN Service is usually available in that EEA member state or not.<br>2.2.    Please read these Terms and Conditions of Use (&quot;Conditions&quot;) before subscribing to the DAZN Service. For the avoidance of doubt, any offers, promotions or discounts that you may receive may be subject to additional terms and conditions which either supersede or supplement these Conditions. In the event of a conflict between these Conditions and the additional terms and conditions, the additional terms and conditions shall prevail.<br>2.3.    We may modify these Conditions, including, by way of example only, due to a change to applicable law or to ensure better functionality of the DAZN Service, provided that the overall subscription structure of the DAZN Service as a whole will not be changed to your disadvantage (subject to clause 4.8).  Revisions to these Conditions will be notified to you by us via email notice to the most recent email address we hold for you. Any changes to our payment terms will also be notified to you directly. You will be deemed to have accepted these modified Conditions, unless you object to the changes within fourteen (14) days from that notification, provided that we will make you aware of this consequence of a lack of objection in the notification.<br>2.4.    The DAZN Service and any content viewed through the DAZN Service are for your personal and non-commercial use only. When you are a DAZN Service subscriber, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, licence to access the DAZN Service and to view the Content on a streaming-only basis. Except for the foregoing limited licence, no right, title, or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the DAZN Service for public performances.<br>2.5.    Your subscription with us is conditional on any required payment due from time to time being authorised by your supported payment provider or your subscription code or promotional code being valid (if applicable) and is at all times subject to these Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, payment will only be accepted from a payment provider based in the territory from which you wish to sign up to the DAZN Service.<br>2.6.    You agree that we may share information with third party rights holders in relation to the Content which is viewed by you when using the DAZN Service. Such information shall be shared on an anonymous basis.<br>2.7.    We may terminate our agreement with you at any time with sixty (60) days’ prior notice via email to the end of the current subscription period. Our right to terminate the agreement for cause in accordance with Section 8.2 shall remain unaffected. If we terminate your agreement with us other than as a result of your breach, you may be entitled to receive a pro-rata refund of any amounts you have pre-paid for the DAZN Service.<br> 3.    Free Trials<br>3.1.    If you are lucky enough to be offered a free trial of the DAZN Service, any free trial period will be specified to you during the sign-up process. We may provide offers and discounts in respect of the DAZN Service at any time. Such offers may not apply to your individual account.<br>3.2.    Your Payment Method (as defined below) will be billed for your monthly subscription fee at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your subscription prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the monthly subscription price and the end date of your free trial period, visit our website and click on the &quot;My Account&quot; page.  If you signed up for the DAZN Service using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you may need to cancel your subscription in accordance with Section 5.2.<br> <br>4.    The Financials<br>4.1.    You are fully responsible for all charges relating to and equipment required for use of the DAZN Service.<br>4.2.    Your subscription will only cover access to the DAZN Service. Telephone line and other communications or access costs may be charged to you separately by your ISP or relevant service provider. All our prices are inclusive of tax (VAT/ MwSt / CT or any similar tax in any other territory or jurisdiction) at the rates in force from time to time.<br>4.3.    Payment must be made by credit card; debit card;  Paypal or through another current, valid, accepted method of payment including supported third party payment providers (“Payment Method”). You confirm that any such Payment Method that you use is yours, or that you have the authorisation of the card or account holder to use it. All accounts and Payment Methods are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the Payment Method provider. If your Payment Method is refused then you will not be granted access to the DAZN Service until a validated Payment Method is provided by you and approved by us.<br>For some Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you certain fees, such as a foreign transaction fee or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.<br>4.4.    We reserve the right to refuse payments at our reasonable discretion.<br>4.5.    The fee to be paid for use of the DAZN Service will be billed on a monthly basis to your chosen Payment Method on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paid subscription or as otherwise specified by the issuer of your Payment Method. In some cases the date for billing may change, for example if your subscription began on a day not contained in a given month. Where we process your payment, we will process your payment on a secure site.<br>4.6.    You can view your next payment date and change your method of payment by visiting our website and clicking on the &quot;My Account&quot; link, or by doing so through our app. If you signed up for the DAZN Service using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you may need to visit your account with the applicable third party to view payment information and change your method of payment.<br>4.7.   Subject to the notice requirements at Section 2.3 above, we may change our service plans from time to time, provided that the changes are reasonably tolerable for you.<br>4.8.    We reserve the right to increase the price for the DAZN Service due to changing market conditions, significant increases in our costs for procuring or providing the DAZN Service or in the event of VAT, MwSt or CT changes or any similar tax. Furthermore, we reserve the right to adjust the price in the event of a significant change in the consumer price index of the German Federal Statistic Authority, provided that an increase by 0,5 percentage points or more compared to the reference period of the previous year shall be considered a significant change. Any price increases shall apply at the earliest after thirty (30) days as of our e-mail notification to your most recently registered e-mail address<i>.</i><br>4.9 In some instances, you may be offered the opportunity to suspend your subscription to the DAZN Service for a limited period by logging in to the “My Account” page. Where you have opted to suspend your subscription, your subscription will automatically restart at the end of such period on the date specified on the “My Account” page. On restart, the monthly fee will be payable and your chosen Payment Method will be billed on the calendar day corresponding to the recommencement of your paid subscription (or as otherwise specified by the issuer of your Payment Method). In some cases the date for billing may change, for example if your subscription began on a day not contained in a subsequent month.<br>5.    Termination by You<br>5.1. You may cancel your subscription to the DAZN Services by logging in on the “My Account” page and clicking on the &quot;Cancel Membership&quot; button. You may cancel your subscription to the DAZN Service at any time prior to the expiry of your subscription period, but you will continue to have access to the DAZN Services for the duration of your subscription period. We do not refund any subscription fees paid in case of your cancellation.<br>5.2. If you signed up for the DAZN Service using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your subscription to the DAZN Service, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the DAZN Service through that third party. You may also find additional billing information about your subscription to the DAZN Service by visiting your account with the applicable third party.<br>6.    Right of Withdrawal<br>You have the right to withdraw from the contract within fourteen (14) days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period shall be fourteen (14) days and starts on the day of conclusion of the contract. In order to exercise your right of withdrawal, please send us – Perform Investment Limited, Hanover House, Plane Tree Crescent, Feltham, United Kingdom, TW13 7BZ – an unambiguous message (e.g. via regular postal mail, telefax or email to help@DAZN.com).

The deadline is deemed to be met if you post the notice of withdrawal prior to the expiry of the withdrawal period.<br>6.1. Consequences of Withdrawal<br>If you withdraw from the contract, we will refund all payments which we have received from you, including shipping costs (except from any additional costs arising due to the fact that you have not opted for the cheapest standard shipment offered by us) immediately and no later than fourteen (14) days after receipt of your notice of withdrawal. For the refund we use the same method of payment that you have used for the original transaction, unless otherwise agreed with you; in no event, we will charge a refund fee.<br>In case you have asked us to start the service within the withdrawal period, you must pay a reasonable amount corresponding to the share of the services provided until the date of exercising the right of withdrawal in relation to the entire services to be provided as per the contract.<br>6.2. Expiration of the Right of Withdrawal<br>In the case of a contract for the supply of digital content that is not contained in a tangible medium, the right of withdrawal expires also if we began with the performance of the contract after you (i) have expressly consented to us beginning with the performance of the contract prior to expiry of the withdrawal period, and (ii) have acknowledged that by your consent, you would lose the right to withdraw from the contract upon the performance of the contract having commenced.<br>7. Technical Requirements<br>7.1.    You are responsible for ensuring that you have and maintain all the hardware and software necessary to access, receive and view the DAZN Service.<br>7.2.    We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that the DAZN Service is made available to you at all times. However, the DAZN Service is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis. Except within the boundaries of Sections 7.4 and 12 below, we will not have any liability to you for the cancellation or abandonment of any event or the failure to show any event as scheduled or advertised, nor where you are unable to watch any event on any specific platform device.<br>7.3.    From time to time we may need to suspend the DAZN Service to carry out upgrades or maintenance. We will try to keep any such suspension to a minimum.<br>7.4.    We will provide the DAZN Service with reasonable care and skill. Apart from this we make no representation or warranty (and, subject to Section 12, exclude all warranties and conditions otherwise implied, to the fullest extent permitted by law). This does not affect any other statutory rights you may have as a consumer. We (and not any third party payment provider) are responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the DAZN Service and/or your use of the DAZN Service.<br>7.5. In circumstances where there has been any failure of the DAZN Service to conform to any applicable warranty and you believe you are entitled to a refund, please contact us using the contact us form or through the contact us section of our app. Where you signed up for the DAZN Service using a third party payment provider, you may notify your third party payment provider of such failure, and your third party payment provider may refund any applicable purchase price for the DAZN Service to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, that third party payment provider has no other warranty or obligation whatsoever with respect to the DAZN Service. Refunds (where applicable) will be processed via your selected Payment Method.<br>7.6.    The quality of the display of the streaming of sport events may vary from computer to computer, and device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection.<br>7.7.    A minimum download speed of at least 9.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content, which is defined as 720p or better. You should check with your ISP for information on possible Internet data usage charges. We will support a minimum bitrate of 800kps in all television devices which use the DAZN Service.<br>7.8.    The streaming software used to deliver the DAZN Service may vary by device and medium, and functionalities may also differ between devices.

All material, including but not limited to the design, text, software, graphics, footage and images you receive (and any selection or arrangement) are subject to the copyright of us and/or others. In the event of any third party claim that the DAZN Service or your use of the DAZN Service infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, we (and not a third party payment provider) are solely responsible for the investigation, defence, a potential settlement and potential discharge of such claim. You agree that you will:<br>8.1.1. use the DAZN Service for non-commercial purposes only without making any gain, whether financial or otherwise, and that you will not permit any other person or persons to use the DAZN Service.

However, such notification may not always be possible.<br>8.3.    Your subscription entitles you to use the DAZN Service on a maximum of two (2) devices at any one time. In accordance with Section 8.1.2 above, you agree that the login details are unique to you and should not be shared with any other person. You can change your login details at any time by visiting our website and clicking on the &quot;My Account&quot; page.<br>8.4.    We retain the right to remove, or alter, any content made available through the DAZN Service at any time, provided that the changes are reasonably tolerable for you. <br> 9.    Your Security Protection<br>You should be mindful of any communication requesting that you submit credit card or other account information. Providing your information in response to these types of communications can result in identity theft. Always access your sensitive account information by going directly to the DAZN Service and not through a hyperlink in an email or any other electronic communication, even if it looks official.<br>10.    Age Restriction<br>You must be the older of 18 years of age (or over), or the age of majority in your state, province or territory of residence, to become a user of the DAZN Services.<br>11.    Indemnity<br>11.1.    You agree to fully compensate us in respect of any damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) that we incur as a result of:<br>11.1.1.    any negligent or wilful misrepresentation, act or omission made by you in connection with your use of the DAZN Service;<br>11.1.2.    any negligent or wilful non-compliance by you with these Conditions; or<br>11.1.3.    claims brought by third parties arising from or related to your negligent or wilful access or use of the DAZN Service other than in accordance with these Conditions.<br>11.2. Damages within the meaning of Section 11.1. also comprise liabilities that we have towards our affiliates or our (including our affiliate’s) licensors (including their affiliates) due to any of the events described in Sections 11.1.1. – 11.1.3.<br>12.    Liability<br>12.1.    Subject to Section 12.2., the maximum liability of each of us and any third party right holder to you arising by reason of or in connection with the supply of the DAZN Service to you shall be limited to such damage as typically foreseeable in the event of a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual duty under these Conditions. A “material contractual duty” under these Conditions is a duty the fulfilment of which is essential for the proper execution of these Conditions, the breach of which endangers the purpose of these Conditions and on the fulfilment of which you as the user regularly rely. Loss or damage is “typically foreseeable” if it was typically foreseeable at the time that you accepted these Conditions. We exclude our and any third party rights holder’s liability for damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a non-material contractual duty.<br>12.2. Nothing in these Conditions shall exclude or limit the liability of us and/or any third party rights holder for gross negligence or wilfulness or for death or personal injury or for its fraud. Likewise, your potential further mandatory statutory rights as a consumer shall remain unaffected.<br>12.3.    Where the DAZN Service contains links to sites and resources provided by third parties, we have no control over the contents of those sites, resources or services. Any use of such third party sites, resources or services will be covered by that third party&#39;s terms and conditions and privacy policy, and we accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them.<br>12.4.    Commentary and other materials posted on the DAZN Service are not intended to amount to advice on which reliance should be placed.
