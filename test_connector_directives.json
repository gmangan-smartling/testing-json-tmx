    "termsOfService_text": " Terms &amp; Conditions<br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE<br>1.    About Us<br>1.1.    Hello and welcome to the world of DAZN. We are a subscription service that provides subscribers with access to a wide range of sports events from around the world streamed to a range of devices including Internet-connected TVs, computers and other platforms (&quot;DAZN Service&quot;). To enhance your enjoyment of the DAZN Service we will also provide recommendations of broadcasts you might be interested in and other interesting sports information.<br>1.2.    The DAZN Service is provided to you by Perform Investment Limited (“We&quot;, &quot;Us&quot;).  We (and not a third party payment provider) are solely responsible for the provision of the DAZN Service and application.<br> 2.    Key Terms of Use<br>2.1.    We provide an online video service offering (among other things) streaming of sporting events (both live and on-demand), highlights of sporting events and other related content, the composition and availability of which may vary over time (collectively &quot;Content&quot;). The Content is usually subject to certain restrictions (including, but not limited to, certain territorial restrictions). You will be able to access and enjoy the DAZN Service within any country where the DAZN Service is available although the Content (and the language it is available in) will vary from territory to territory. If you are verified as being entitled to portability (see our FAQs on this subject), you will be able to access and enjoy the DAZN Service when you are temporally present in another member state of the <a href=\"https://www.linguee.com/english-german/translation/European+Economic+Area.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">European Economic Area</span></span></a> (“EEA”), irrespective of whether the DAZN Service is usually available in that EEA member state or not.<br>2.2.    Please read these Terms and Conditions of Use (&quot;Conditions&quot;) before subscribing to the DAZN Service. For the avoidance of doubt, any offers, promotions or discounts that you may receive may be subject to additional terms and conditions which either supersede or supplement these Conditions. In the event of a conflict between these Conditions and the additional terms and conditions, the additional terms and conditions shall prevail.<br>2.3.    We may modify these Conditions, including, by way of example only, due to a change to applicable law or to ensure better functionality of the DAZN Service, provided that the overall subscription structure of the DAZN Service as a whole will not be changed to your disadvantage (subject to clause 4.8).  Revisions to these Conditions will be notified to you by us via email notice to the most recent email address we hold for you. Any changes to our payment terms will also be notified to you directly. You will be deemed to have accepted these modified Conditions, unless you object to the changes within fourteen (14) days from that notification, provided that we will make you aware of this consequence of a lack of objection in the notification.<br>2.4.    The DAZN Service and any content viewed through the DAZN Service are for your personal and non-commercial use only. When you are a DAZN Service subscriber, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, licence to access the DAZN Service and to view the Content on a streaming-only basis. Except for the foregoing limited licence, no right, title, or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the DAZN Service for public performances.<br>2.5.    Your subscription with us is conditional on any required payment due from time to time being authorised by your supported payment provider or your subscription code or promotional code being valid (if applicable) and is at all times subject to these Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, payment will only be accepted from a payment provider based in the territory from which you wish to sign up to the DAZN Service.<br>2.6.    You agree that we may share information with third party rights holders in relation to the Content which is viewed by you when using the DAZN Service. Such information shall be shared on an anonymous basis.<br>2.7.    We may terminate our agreement with you at any time with sixty (60) days’ prior notice via email to the end of the current subscription period. Our right to terminate the agreement for cause in accordance with Section 8.2 shall remain unaffected. If we terminate your agreement with us other than as a result of your breach, you may be entitled to receive a pro-rata refund of any amounts you have pre-paid for the DAZN Service.<br> 3.    Free Trials<br>3.1.    If you are lucky enough to be offered a free trial of the DAZN Service, any free trial period will be specified to you during the sign-up process. We may provide offers and discounts in respect of the DAZN Service at any time. Such offers may not apply to your individual account.<br>3.2.    Your Payment Method (as defined below) will be billed for your monthly subscription fee at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your subscription prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the monthly subscription price and the end date of your free trial period, visit our website and click on the &quot;My Account&quot; page.  If you signed up for the DAZN Service using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you may need to cancel your subscription in accordance with Section 5.2.<br> <br>4.    The Financials<br>4.1.    You are fully responsible for all charges relating to and equipment required for use of the DAZN Service.<br>4.2.    Your subscription will only cover access to the DAZN Service. Telephone line and other communications or access costs may be charged to you separately by your ISP or relevant service provider.
